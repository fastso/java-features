* Omit the types of all lambda parameters unless their presence makes your program clearer.
* Lambdas lack names and documentation; if a computation isn’t self-explanatory, or exceeds a few lines, don’t put it in a lambda.
* You should rarely, if ever, serialize a lambda.
* Don’t use anonymous classes for function objects unless you have to create instances of types that aren’t functional interfaces.
