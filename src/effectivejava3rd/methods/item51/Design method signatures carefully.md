* Choose method names carefully.
* Donâ€™t go overboard in providing convenience methods. When in doubt, leave it out.
* Avoid long parameter lists. Long sequences of identically typed parameters are especially harmful.
* For parameter types, favor interfaces over classes.
* Prefer two-element enum types to boolean parameters, unless the meaning of the boolean is clear from the method name.

# There are three techniques for shortening overly long parameter lists.
* One is to break the method up into multiple methods, each of which requires only a subset of the parameters.
* A second technique for shortening long parameter lists is to create helper classes to hold groups of parameters.
* A third technique that combines aspects of the first two is to adapt the Builder pattern from object construction to method invocation.
