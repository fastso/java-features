* The choice of which overloading to invoke is made at compile time.
* Selection among overloaded methods is static, while selection among overridden methods is dynamic.
* Avoid confusing uses of overloading.
* A safe, conservative policy is never to export two overloadings with the same number of parameters.
* You can always give methods different names instead of overloading them.
* Do not overload methods to take different functional interfaces in the same argument position.
