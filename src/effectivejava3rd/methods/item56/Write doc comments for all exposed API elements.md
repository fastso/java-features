* To document your API properly, you must precede every exported class, interface, constructor, method, and field declaration with a doc comment.
* The doc comment for a method should describe succinctly the contract between the method and its client. 
* Doc comments should be readable both in the source code and in the generated documentation.
* No two members or constructors in a class or interface should have the same summary description. 
* When documenting a generic type or method, be sure to document all type parameters.
* When documenting an enum type, be sure to document the constants.
* When documenting an annotation type, be sure to document any members.
* Whether or not a class or static method is thread-safe, you should document its thread-safety level.
* Read the web pages generated by the Javadoc utility.
