* Always declare checked exceptions individually, and document precisely the conditions under which each one is thrown using the Javadoc @throws tag.
* Use the Javadoc @throws tag to document each exception that a method can throw, but do not use the throws keyword on unchecked exceptions.
* If an exception is thrown by many methods in a class for the same reason, you can document the exception in the classâ€™s documentation comment.
