* It is not always possible to write a default method that maintains all invariants of every conceivable implementation.
* In the presence of default methods, existing implementations of an interface may compile without error or warning but fail at runtime.
* It is still of the utmost importance to design interfaces with great care.
* While it may be possible to correct some interface flaws after an interface is released, you cannot count on it.
