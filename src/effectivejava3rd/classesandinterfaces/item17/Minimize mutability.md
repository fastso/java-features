To make a class immutable, follow these five rules:
* Don’t provide methods that modify the object’s state.
* Ensure that the class can’t be extended. 
* Make all fields final.
* Make all fields private.
* Ensure exclusive access to any mutable components.

Other Tips
* Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe; they require no synchronization.
* Immutable objects can be shared freely.
* Not only can you share immutable objects, but they can share their internals. 
* Immutable objects make great building blocks for other objects.
* Immutable objects provide failure atomicity for free.
* The major disadvantage of immutable classes is that they require a separate object for each distinct value.

Summary
* Classes should be immutable unless there’s a very good reason to make them mutable.
* If a class cannot be made immutable, limit its mutability as much as possible.
* Declare every field private final unless there’s a good reason to do otherwise.
* Constructors should create fully initialized objects with all of their invariants established.
