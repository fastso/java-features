* The most powerful technique for minimizing the scope of a local variable is to declare it where it is first used.
* Nearly every local variable declaration should contain an initializer.
* Prefer for loops to while loops, assuming the contents of the loop variable arenâ€™t needed after the loop terminates.
* keep methods small and focused.
