* A major cost of implementing Serializable is that it decreases the flexibility to change a class’s implementation once it has been released. 
* A second cost of implementing Serializable is that it increases the likelihood of bugs and security holes.
* A third cost of implementing Serializable is that it increases the testing burden associated with releasing a new version of a class.
* Implementing Serializable is not a decision to be undertaken lightly. 
* Classes designed for inheritance should rarely implement Serializable, and interfaces should rarely extend it.
* Inner classes should not implement Serializable.
