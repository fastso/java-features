* To associate data with enum constants, declare instance fields and write a constructor that takes the data and stores it in the fields. 
* Switches on enums are good for augmenting enum types with constant-specific behavior. 
* Use enums any time you need a set of constants whose members are known at compile time.
* It is not necessary that the set of constants in an enum type stay fixed for all time.
