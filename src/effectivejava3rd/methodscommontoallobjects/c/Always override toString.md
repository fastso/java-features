* Providing a good toString implementation makes your class much more pleasant to use and makes systems using the class easier to debug.
* When practical, the toString method should return all of the interesting information contained in the object.
* Whether or not you decide to specify the format, you should clearly document your intentions. 
* Provide programmatic access to the information contained in the value returned by toString.
